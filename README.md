- 👋 Hi, I’m @dave-brickner
- I am a retired engineer. My career was mostly in avionics specifically magnetics, gyros, and displays.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning software associated with Raspberry Pi and pico
- 🌱 I’m currently learning enough software and sensor applications to build a self balancing robot.
- There are hundreds of you tube videos on the subject but, I want to practice some engineering.
- 💞️ My longer project ida is to combine the output of a triad of IMU's to see if performance improvements are possible.
